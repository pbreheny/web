### Neon tutorial

The Department of Biostatistics has a dedicated node on the Neon supercomputing cluster at the University of Iowa.  My tutorial on how to use this resource is located [here](neon).

### SAS Macro tutorial

[Here](misc/macros.pdf) is a presentation/tutorial I have given a few times on SAS Macros.

### University of Iowa thesis template

[Here](misc/uithesis.tar.gz) is a template for writing a thesis that conforms to
University of Iowa formatting guidelines (at least, as of 2015).  Once you
extract the files, you should be able to run `pdflatex` on `thesis.tex` to
produce the skeleton of a thesis.  If any guidelines have changed and the style
file needs modified, let me know.
