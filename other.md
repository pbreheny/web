### Biostatistics resources

There are many useful projects over at our department's [Biostatistics Resources](https://iowabiostat.github.io/) page, including:

* [HPC tutorial](https://iowabiostat.github.io/hpc/index.html): A hands-on tutorial for learning how to use the high-performance computing (HPC) resources at the University of Iowa.
* [Math review](https://iowabiostat.github.io/math-review/index.html): A guide intended to review of fundamental math concepts for students who will be starting an MS or PhD program in biostatistics.
* [Data sets](https://iowabiostat.github.io/data-sets/): A collection of data sets intended to be used for teaching or for illustrating methodology on real data.
* [Thesis template](https://github.com/IowaBiostat/thesis-template): A template for writing a LaTeX thesis that conforms to University of Iowa formatting guidelines.

and more.

### GWAS tutorial

[Here](https://pbreheny.github.io/adv-gwas-tutorial/) is a link to a hands-on tutorial for carrying out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using R. This has been co-developed by myself and several of my graduate students over the years. Current status: there's enough here to be useful, for sure, but definitely still a work in progress in a state of ongoing development.

### Big data lab

[Here](https://pbreheny.org/4110/big-data-lab.html) is a lab titled "Working with big data in genomics" that I have given for our Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics students.

### SAS Macro tutorial

[Here](assets/macros.pdf) is a presentation/tutorial I have given a few times on SAS Macros.
