### HPC tutorial

The Department of Biostatistics has several dedicated nodes on the High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at the University of Iowa.  My tutorial on how to use this resource is located [here](https://iowabiostat.github.io/hpc/index.html).

### Big data lab

[Here](misc/big-data-lab.html) is a lab titled "Working with big data in genomics" that I have given for our Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics students.  NOTE: Data is currently unavailable for download -- I need to resolve some data-sharing issues.  My apologies.

### SAS Macro tutorial

[Here](misc/macros.pdf) is a presentation/tutorial I have given a few times on SAS Macros.

### University of Iowa thesis template

[Here](misc/uithesis.tar.gz) is a template for writing a thesis that conforms to
University of Iowa formatting guidelines (at least, as of 2015).  Once you
extract the files, you should be able to run `pdflatex` on `thesis.tex` to
produce the skeleton of a thesis.  If any guidelines have changed and the style
file needs modified, let me know.
